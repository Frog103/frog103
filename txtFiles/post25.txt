A quick sketch practice I decided to do spontaneously. About halfway through I decided I wasn't going to go through my usual process 
and I chose to try a hand at hatching in the details. The poportions in some areas look a little wonky because I didnt erase or undo most of 
the strokes I made, but I was able to replicate my general style pretty closely which surprised me, especially on my first go around.
