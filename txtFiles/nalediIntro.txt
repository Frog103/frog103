Naledi is the leading protagonist of Gravitas, making her debut at the onset of the story after arriving from an undisclosed region beyond the borders of the main setting. Raised in comfort by accomplished parents, she grew increasingly restless under the weight of their legacy and set out on her own, armed only with a bicycle, a travel bag, and a desire to prove herself.

After wandering the country for months on end, her impulsive nature led her to Moriah, an expansive city-state renowned for its technological society and its national sport Gravita, a high-speed gravity-defying game passionately revered by citizens all over.
However, her honeymoon period would quickly end after discovering that she was bound by local regulations that prevented her from leaving, along with the fact that her personal funds were rapidly diminishing, putting any ambitions she held to a grinding halt.

It isnâ€™t until she stops to eat at a particular store one day that she finds an unexpected opportunity, one that promises to propel her journey forward instead of bringing it to a premature end.
