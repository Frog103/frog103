. Nadjia’s Rise to Power (Year 756-763, Mephian Calendar)
Nadjia Uhalat, a scholar in Umagia forms a pact with Menra, gaining power and knowledge. She sets out to create a vessel strong enough to house Menra’s essence along with secretly trying to achieve an agenda of her own: Discovering the connection between mortality and divinity and achieving it herself.
Menra, impatient with Nadjia’s slow pacing, gradually encourages Nadjia to abandon her ethics, leading her to meet infamous criminals in the underworld. Her charisma and wit allow her to convince these hardened convicts to work together.
o	Teunis, a renowned mage similar to Nadjia, who helps her research forbidden magics and acquire magic items.
o	Gameel, a well-respected drug lord and hitman, who commands an army of dealers and assassins alike.
o	Ereges, A black market dealer and sailor, who is unmatched in logistics. 
Through Menra’s influence, and the help of her new allies, Nadjia networks and expands a massive slave trafficking scheme spanning nearly the whole globe, using human test subjects for her magical research. 
o	One of Nadjia’s first experiments toward her goal involves directly removing the magic energy from a subject in order to create a vessel for Menra to Inhabit, but the initial tests fail, adversely causing the mass creation of Echoes.
o	With the help of Gameel, Nadjia creates three genetically engineered parasites that bond to a host and gradually increase the host’s magic capacity through absorption of others, but the experiment fails. One parasite and its main host dies during the process, and another attempts a successful escape into the outside world. The last became unstable and transformed into a monstrosity, but is currently restrained in an isolated facility.
Ereges discovers Genna Island (Year 756), a hidden island, and Nadjia moves her test subjects there, creating a false history and culture for the population to control them.
 
Gameel creates an elite force of assassins named the Nubilim, who ensure that moral authorities don’t interfere with their crime operations. 
o	The Nubilim are all extremely gifted magic users and ruthless hitmen who enforce the will of Nadjia and Co. by any means necessary.
	Cerberus: a notorious assassin and magic user who is known for using her three Tails during combat, gaining her the moniker of Reaper. She can control each with lightning speed precision, opting to dismember her foes before they can react.
	Larunia: A powerful magic user who is obsessed with dragons. She uses her magic to physically manifest the image of one during combat. Dragons are incredibly powerful creatures, rumored by the Vaephilim to have descended from Nazerati himself. Despite her proficiency with magic, Larunia can only create one appendage at a time, (Head, Arms, Legs, Tail) though it is more than enough to make her a formidable foe against even armies. 
	Phobian: A genetically enhanced, super soldier that wields unmatched physical strength. His brute strength rivals that of even magic users.
Teunis suggests Nadjia take a more slow and natural approach, compared to her other attempts. Proposing that motivating a subject through adversity could increase the natural capacity of a subject to provide stable enough results for her research.
With the help of Teunis, Nadjia develops and introduces Charms to the Genna Island population, magical items that grant easy access to magic for the islanders but also filter, track, and regulate their magic for Nadjia’s benefit.
Arderé, born in Gnos in 754, is one of the many children and slaves that were moved to Genna in the year 757. 
After her parents die, Arderé ventures into the Genna Forest in the year 772 and accidentally activates a hidden teleportation charm, transporting her back to Gnos. There, she is bonded with a symbiotic parasite that allows her to drain and use magic from others, transforming her into a powerful and volatile figure.
During the years 757-763, these key characters were born:
o	Sarin, Year 758
o	Emberlyn, Year 757
o	Kyi, Year 759
o	Rivets, Year 762
o	Vivian, Year 763
o	Atlai, Year 762
Between the years 772 and 774, Arderé gains notoriety amongst Nadjia’s Syndicate because of her destructive and reckless vigilante work, Gaining her the nickname: Flower Witch.
1.2. Genna Island Events Leading to the Current Narrative (Year 770-774)
In 770, Rivets (Sarin’s sister) and a group of children discover an ancient relic on Genna Island. Unbeknownst to her, Rivets absorbs the energy of the deity Sāmaya, storing the dormant god within her.
In 773, The adult population of Genna Island mysteriously vanishes, leaving only the children behind. (Orchestrated by Nadjia)
In 774, Grenden becomes aware of the island’s eventual fate through cryptic visions from a child seer on the island named Grisailles. However, she keeps this information secret, hoping to avert the coming disaster.
Left to cope with the chaos, the remaining children begin organizing their lives on the island without adult supervision.
Grenden, Misa, Lamiya, Greta, and Indri along with other key figures take on leadership roles, trying to maintain order and investigate the mysteries surrounding the island.

--- Start of Present narrative

Sarin is seen fighting a small group of Echoes within the depths of the island’s forest. After swiftly dispatching them, he sets up to return to the village and report his efforts to the Oracle. While making his way toward the town gates, he comes across abnormally large and distinct footprints. Concerned, he takes a detour to follow them, and stumbles upon another patrol group taking a rest within a forest clearing.

Confused, he attempts to search around for the source of the footprints but assumes that the group in front of him must’ve already taken care of it. Now relaxed, Sarin begins to walk toward the group, greeting them from a distance just before taking notice of a presence hiding in the brushwood. Sarin alerts the group ahead to its presence just as it leaps into the clearing, making itself known. The four engage in a fierce battle with what seems to be an Echo much larger than the usual bunch, but they emerge victoriously, nonetheless.

The four recoup after the battle, and Sarin assists the three, named Liza, Barret, and Penne with wrapping up their own expedition before returning to the Oracle to report their efforts along with the sighting of the abnormal Echo. The group splits afterward and Sarin begins to make his way toward his home, crossing through the town square first. While there he spots a group that appears to be in a small spat but is advised by a bystander to let it be, reluctantly stating that arguments appear to be occurring a bit more often recently.

Sarin finally reaches the front door of his home before being invited to hang out with Grenden, Skavi, and Rino. They unwind at their usual spot to reflect on prior events and discuss the future of the island. Upon finally returning home, Sarin is scolded by his sister Rivets, who is home unusually early.

The two engage in a short blame game, exchanging various situations where one of them has acted out of line before compromising and finally settling down to eat their dinner. Afterward, Sarin heads to his room to end the day.

The next morning, Sarin heads to the town canteen to eat breakfast, along with deciding to group up with others rather than heading out to patrol by himself. Though the latter finds itself to be a task easier said than done as Sarin finds difficulty deciding who to walk up and talk to, eventually giving up on the idea and leaving the canteen alone. There he is confronted by Skavi and Rino, who conveniently invite him to patrol with them, which he agrees to.

As the three walk toward the town gate, Rino asks Sarin if he’d seen Grenden anywhere today yet, which Sarin declines. They attempt to look around for Grenden for a short while before giving up and heading out for forest patrol.

Later into their expedition, evening strikes, with Sarin and Co. deciding to wrap up for the day and head home. Upon passing by the town square, he encounters a commotion involving some of the island residents arguing. Sarin attempts to diffuse the situation but fails to do so and only aggravates the group further.

Soon after, Misa joins the heated discussion, suggesting the possibility of a traitor amongst the population who is responsible for the occurrences on the island.

Grenden arrives to intervene, breaking up the gathering, and dismissing Misa’s accusations, stating them to be baseless, along with scolding Misa for needlessly riling up the residents. She later advises Sarin not to bring up the topic or entertain Misa’s claims.

A skeptical Sarin infers that there may be a small truth to the matter and decides it may be worth investigating anyway, secretly going against Grenden’s wishes.

Sarin decides to dedicate some of his time to explore three points of interest, starting with reading up on the information the island has stored about Echoes so far at the Oracle, leaving the investigation of both Misa and Grenden for a later date.

A couple of days later, Sarin wakes up in the morning to take a stroll around town when he comes across a distressed young girl who is only able to respond that she is unable to find someone when probed for answers. After patrolling for some time, the rest of the townsfolk begin to wake, leaving their homes in a similarly confused state, wandering the area also looking for something.

It doesn’t take long for people to figure out the gravity of the situation, realizing that some of them are genuinely missing once again. The ensuing commotion gathers at the town square as they attempt to piece together the situation.

The islanders come to realize that a second wave of disappearances may have occurred overnight, sending everyone into a panic. The stressful environment reminding Sarin that he had not seen his sister before leaving home himself, quickly returning home to witness her empty bedroom. Briefly stricken with grief, Sarin rushes back outdoors.

As fear shreds through the village, Sarin leaves the area to search for Grenden, hoping to find answers to the now looming questions over him.

Sarin finds Grenden at her house and quickly informs her of the situation, and with a stern face, she hastily motions to arm herself and head out just before Sarin stops her, asking if she knows anything about their current situation. However, his poor wording serves only to anger her, and she leaves without a word, seemingly to patrol the village perimeter to defend during the island’s moment of weakness. Sarin follows closely behind.

The two later find themselves deep into the forested area of the island, searching for any Echoes lurking closer to town. During this time, Sarin attempts to persuade Grenden to talk, but only receives silence in return. Soon after, they come across tracks belonging to an Echo but notice that its gait is rather unusual.

Upon discovering the Echo, the two take notice of its critical condition and erratic behavior but are quickly discovered and enter close combat with the monster. The battle was fierce, much more than the two had anticipated.

After the battle, Grenden asks Sarin to patrol closer to home. He attempts to convince Grenden to talk one last time, but is dismissed again, with her excusing that she doesn’t know anything.

Sarin later returns to a town still overrun by panic. At the town square, Sarin runs into a concerned Skavi, who asks Sarin if they’ve seen Rino, who rushed out of town during the commotion claiming to have realized “Something Huge”. She lost track of him and only recovered a torn piece of his clothes.

She asks for Sarin’s help in tracking down Rino or whatever it is he was looking for, and the two return to the depths of the forest to start their search endeavor.

Their search widens, but evening strikes, and they turn up empty-handed. But just as Sarin is about to call off the search, Skavi quietly calls out to him, pointing out at something in the distance. Further up ahead is an apparent scuffle between three Echoes. Further observation reveals that two of the Echoes are abnormally wounded, with the third’s outward appearance heavily suggesting it somehow instigated the event. After watching the infighting play out a little longer, the two hurriedly return to town, to avoid being spotted by the new Echo, wasting no time reporting the new species to the Oracle, though it would take some time before the Islanders operating the Oracle could make any sense of it. As evening strikes, a disappointed Skavi parts ways with Sarin, wondering what Rino’s vague revelation meant.

On Sarin’s way back home, he comes across and eavesdrops on Grenden, Misa, Lamiya, Indri, Greta, and a few others discussing how to plan around the new predicament the Island has been placed in, along with the fact that some groups discovered instances of agitated Echoes that were attacking each other.

However, because of earlier events, the island has lost almost half of their fighting force, along with a handful more that are injured or unwilling to contribute. The gravity of the situation causes the assembly to bicker amongst each other, halting the progress of the discussion.

Misa decides to use the opportunity to bring up Grenden’s recent behavior, noting her abnormal absences and strange behavior, which unexpectedly turns the hostility in the conversation toward her.

Sarin motions to intervene in the conversation, but stops himself from doing so, realizing that Misa’s accusations aren’t completely baseless. Grenden avoids answering any direct questions, leading on until their assembly ends, with everyone departing in a sour mood.

Sarin watches Grenden walk home, conflicted on whether to attempt to confront her a third time, but decides not to, and returns home himself, and although he had only half expected Rivets to show up, she did not, which served to steel his resolve to discover the truth.

Sarin is sleeping when he is awoken by a loud blast. Upon checking outside his room, he heads outside only to discover chaos ravaging the town. After grouping up with Grenden, the two bore through near-endless mobs of Echoes and combat other survivors who turned aggressive due to poisoning. The two make their way toward the town square. Before they're able to investigate, a group of afflicted survivors ambush them.

Grenden makes quick work of them, but her exhaustion leaves her vulnerable, with one of the afflicted moving to take advantage. Sarin immediately moves to intervene, hesitating when faced with the decision to deal a mortal blow. This hesitation causes Grenden to be fatally wounded.

Sarin hustles Grenden to a forested area by the coast in an attempt to treat her, when Grenden rips the dagger spearing her in a moment of hysteria, serving to further her condition. Despite Sarin’s efforts, none of his attempts work to help her. She becomes pale, staring at the starry sky. Grenden speaks to Sarin, asking him to find an escape off the island, ultimately wishing for his safety. Sarin returns his gaze only to realize that she has passed. He turns to the direction of the deepest parts of the forest, moving in intention to find a “source”.

He makes his way deep into the ends of the forest, instinctively feeling the presence of his goal before he hears creaking wood and whispering. Moving closer to the source, he finds himself at the edge of the island.

There he encounters two survivors preparing a boat. Two siblings, Emberlyn and Vivian. The older sister Emberlyn, approaches with hostility, threatening him to leave, but she is stopped by her younger sister, Vivian. Sarin realizes what the two are up to and asks them to aid him in eliminating the source of the monsters.

Emberlyn declines the offer, stating that the island is lost, and it would be naive to think that he alone, or even the three of them could face the danger his ambition would ensue. Respecting her sister’s earlier demands, she offers Sarin a choice; leave with them on their boat in an attempt to find a new world beyond the ocean. Or try to put an end to the monsters who have already laid waste to their home. Conflicted, Sarin eventually gives in, taking Emberlyn up on her offer, and the three set sail, unsure of what may await them in the coming future.

After a grueling trip overseas, the three finally spot land. After finally setting foot in a new world, Emberlyn suggests that the group find fresh water to use. After procuring the necessary resources the three settle down to discuss their plans moving forward.

Emberlyn floats the idea of returning to Genna Island after the fallout, pointing out that attempting to live in unfamiliar lands is not ideal. Sarin suggests against returning, quoting Grenden’s final words. Acknowledging Sarin’s suggestion, Vivian proposes that they attempt to rescue any survivors and bring them to the new lands.

Emberlyn shoots her suggestion down, assuming the endeavor to be risky. Their discussion doesn't make much progress, so they decide to rest before making a decision on their plans.

The next day, the group splits to familiarize themselves with the surrounding area to secure food and supplies.

After venturing deep into the area, Sarin spots vegetation that could provide food. As he moves to gather, he spots something shuffling in his peripheral, he turns around to confront the threat, to be met with a towering figure staring back. A Demi Human. Quickly brandishing his sword, the person speaks, advising against his hostility.

Taking time to observe the situation, surprised by the presence of someone not from Genna Island, he decides that the figure is not an enemy.

The two greet and introduce themselves. The person now named ‘Kijo’ questions what a “Vae” is doing far out north, continuing to ask Sarin if they need help, noting their shabby appearance, and offering aid at her village.

Sarin holds on to the offer, returning to Emberlyn and Vivian to discuss the situation. Vivian expresses curiosity towards the natives, eager to meet them. Sarin concurs with Vivian, suggesting that receiving aid for survival would benefit them greatly, even if they don't plan to stick around. However, they're stopped short by Emberlyn who disapproves of the notion, arguing it would put her and her Vivian at risk. Both Vivian and Sarin eventually convince Emberlyn to accept the offer, and they travel toward the direction of their village.

As the three make their way through the forest, Vivian strikes up a conversation asking Sarin what the native looked like, eagerly awaiting their arrival at the new village. He describes her as an imposing figure with two large horns. Although despite their appearance, they spoke in a soft voice.

The description intrigues Vivian while Emberlyn expresses concern, quoting Star’s description of Kijo’s horns, debating the possibility of them being an Echo.

Vivian disagrees, stating that while Sarin and his sister are the only ones with dark skin on Genna Island, they are not Echoes. Emberlyn eventually relents her skepticism, sarcastically reaffirming with Sarin that they aren’t an Echo. Their journey comes to an end when they finally reach the outskirts of the mentioned village, the three taken aback by its grandeur.

Astonished by the architecture and bustling atmosphere, the group can’t help but compare how greatly Esca Gehenna contrasts with this place.

As the three tour through the town, Kijo appears from the crowds to greet them, guiding them to her residence to continue their discussion where they left off. Upon arriving, Vivian notices a small girl similar in appearance to Kijo secluded in the corner of the room and jumps at the opportunity to talk to her, meanwhile, Sarin, Emberlyn, and Kijo resume their conversation about Kijo’s offer.

Starting the conversation, Kijo immediately states that she is aware that the three are not locals, then inquires as to where they came from.

The two avoid answering questions about their origin until Kijo eventually relents. She offers the two refuge for as long as needed in return for labor work, to which the two agree.

After a week of living under Kijo’s roof, Star and Emberlyn have become accustomed to living in Foarcoast. Meanwhile, Vivian has found companionship in Kijo’s daughter, Atlai.

After a long day of work, Sarin meets with Emberlyn to suggest a return to Genna Island to rescue any survivors, mainly referring to his sister, whom he lost track of during the Echo outbreak.

Hesitant at first, Emberlyn agrees to the task, but only on the condition that her sister Vivian, is not informed of the endeavor and left behind. Over the next two days, they secretly prepare for their trip back home. Finally, the preparations for their rescue mission are complete, and the two embark across the sea once more.

After another long trip overseas, Star and Emberlyn land on Genna Island once more.

The silence befalling the island was deafening, the area seemingly devout of any energy. As they reach the village outskirts, they find it overrun with innumerable number of Echoes. Deciding that combat would not be an option, the two sneak toward Sarin’s house, scouting for clues of any potential survivors.

They finally reach his home, reinvestigating the place but are unable to turn up any clues. Sarin suggests searching one of Rivets' former hangout spots, explaining that she and any possible survivors may have taken refuge there.

Upon reaching the location they find and enter a cave. Searching around the cave, Sarin and Emberlyn fail to turn up any signs of life, until they come across a conspicuously placed boulder. Upon moving it they find a shoddily made living space. upon investigating, Sarin is interrupted by an attack.

Turning to the source of the attack, Sarin and Emberlyn discover a young boy, confused by their sudden appearance.

The boy, named Kyi, becomes relieved to see the two.

Kyi explains that the remaining people after the Echo outbreak did not last, leaving him as the sole survivor. Emberlyn suggests that they take Kyi with them make haste to their boat and return to Foarcoast. They finally reach the boat and sail back to Foarcoast.

On their journey to the village, Sarin, Emberlyn, and Kyi exchange information concerning Genna Island and Foarcoast Village.

After returning from their trip to Genna Island, Sarin, Emberlyn, and Kyi discover Foarcoast Village in ruins.

Frantically searching for residents of the area, Sarin and Kyi only turn up with a tattered map, with several locations marked and a single route leading to the other end of the map.

The two spend some time deciphering the marks and which direction to search first, when Emberlyn interjects, asserting the idea that they should travel north to find answers, while her charm emits an intense glow.

They prepare for a long journey and set out north of Foarcoast Village.

Traveling through the northern forest, Sarin starts a conversation, asking Kyi what occurred in Genna Island after Emberlyn and Sarin’s escape.

Deep in thought, Kyi recounts the events that transpired thus far, starting their recap the week after the second wave of disappearances.

Organizing a flood of new information and speculation, Kyi, among a few other scouts discusses and allocates their supplies and forces in their records building named The Oracle.

The group toils to properly allocate their now meager fighting force to keep the encroaching Echoes at bay, worrying that they may be stretching their more esteemed fighters, particularly, Grenden, Misa, Greta, Indri, and Lamiya, too thin.

The group continues to argue how they assign their forces when Skavi enters, proposing the idea of locating a possible origin point of the Echoes, and eliminating it, mentioning Rio’s sudden revelation and disappearance.

The Oracle group contemplates, but once again argues the idea, debating the existence of the origin point, or if they even have the resources to devote to the endeavor.

Kyi eventually speaks up, stating that he’ll assign himself, Skavi, and two other scouts to look into the possibility of the origin point.

Two days before the Echo outbreak, Kyi and Lamiya are seen at a coastal area, where Kyi confides in her, telling her about the presumably dangerous trip into Echo territory which would take place the next day.

He explains having mixed feelings following through with the expedition, regretting assigning himself as a participant. She gives Kyi a few words of encouragement, claiming the four would return home as heroes, and she wants to be the first to see their fruits of labor.

After Lamiya’s pep talk, Kyi returns home to prepare for the expedition.

On the day of the expedition, Kyi, Skavi, and two other scouts gather at the edge of the western forest. Skavi, the lead of the operation debriefs the team on their goal, follow Rino’s tracks, find the origin point of the Echoes, and if possible, destroy it.

The four set out deep into the forest, scouring for any clues. They spend the evening searching the forest until they come across a particularly tall cliff, with a piece of Rino's clothing hanging atop one of the ridges.

Kyi and the other two scouts identify the cliff and the surrounding area as Echo infested and dangerous, suggesting a retreat to recruit one of the big five to assist.

Skavi asserts that leaving to regroup isn’t an option, claiming that they are close to discovering a revelation just as Rino was. Either way, they continue and scale the cliff.

Upon reaching the cliff’s summit, a dark atmosphere befalls the place. The group pushes on, eventually discovering a multitude of mangled trees, seemingly torn apart by some sort of animal. The scouts split to investigate the area to determine what might have left the tracks.

Kyi investigates the ground, looking into the various tracks left on the floor. He turns to Skavi to inform her before noticing that she is staring past a tree, frozen in fear.

Before Kyi can ask Skavi what’s wrong, an Echo lunges from the darkness, attacking the group. They quickly make a retreat and return to The Oracle.

Upon arriving at The Oracle, the group records everything they saw. However, a fear-stricken Skavi does not report on her findings and heads home. They record and prepare for another expedition into the dangerous area.

The next morning, Kyi returns to The Oracle to continue their exploration beyond the cliffs area. Indri and Lamiya both arrive at the Oracle, to aid the group, along with one other scout. However, Skavi does not show up.

Deciding to continue without her, the expedition group moves out to the forest. However, before they leave the village, Indri takes notice that the other end of the village is under siege.

Rushing to the scene, the group finds the village under attack by numerous Echoes. Attempting to fight back to save the residents, they quickly find themselves overwhelmed, even with the aid of Indri and Lamiya.

Lamiya determines that the sector of the village is lost and orders a retreat and evacuation to all who are able. The Echoes continue their siege deep into the village, pillaging everything in their path.

As they retreat to the town square, a particularly persistent Echo impedes their path. It chases the group to a coastal cliff, where they dive off into the water to evade its pursuit.

Upon exiting the water, the four overlook the decimated and scorched remains of the village.

Kyi and Lamiya suggest the next best course of action for them would be to hide out until everything has died down, so they may be able to get a grasp of what caused the event.

The four take refuge in a cave by the coast and rest.

The next day Indri and the other scout make a plan to investigate the remains of the village, encouraging the other two to stay behind to ensure the group’s safety. However, the two never return from the expedition that day.

After some time, Lamiya opts to venture outside the cave in search of Indri and the others, promising Kiy she would return successful, despite their promise, she does not return either.

Multiple days pass as Kyi hides in the cave by their lonesome, haunted by the outside noises of presumed Echoes hunting.

Finally, he hears something entering the cave, preparing for combat, he soon discovers that it was Sarin and Emberlyn.

Sarin, Emberlyn, and Kyi leave behind the desolate Foarcoast Village following Emberlyn’s advice. Their journey north reveals a gradual change in the landscape from harsh coasts to verdant woodlands.

On the outskirts, a small patrol of elven scouts led by a determined but stern scout named Evaneth mistakenly accuses the trio of orchestrating the Foarcoast attack, insisting on their arrest.

Sarin attempts to negotiate and de-escalate the situation, but fails to do so, instead they opt to flee the situation, retreating further north into the forest, with the scouts in close pursuit.

After two days of playing cat & mouse, the trio eventually tires, allowing the elven scouts to catch up to them, where another confrontation ensues. Fortunately, the misconceptions brewed between the two groups are cleared, with Evaneth’s group apologizing and asking the trio for information on the event.

After explaining their situation, (Though leaving out details concerning Genna Island) the elven scouts offer to escort the group to Dryalis, where they could work together on finding a solution in an official capacity.

After some time traveling, the group finally arrives at the border of Dryalis, and more specifically its first district, which is overseen by two joint rulers. Upon entering, the group is at first met with wary gazes, which are quickly replaced with eager, curious stares.

Evaneth once again offers the group to rest at a nearby inn for a day before they take the three to see the region’s leaders, Parmiel and Lanciel, to inform them of recent events.

Upon reaching the inn and entering their room, Sarin expresses his discomfort of the environment, specifically noting the overfriendly nature of the elven residents, which seems to be mainly directed at him, without any obvious reason as to why. Emberlyn and Kyi jokingly shrug it off, leaving Sarin to ponder his situation as the other two head to sleep.

The following morning, the three decide to wander about the area to explore the various facilities splayed about before their meeting with Evaneth. Though Sarin’s earlier concerns only seem to make themself more prevalent as they interact with various elven residents around the area.

Finally, Evaneth finds the three loitering about and formally invites them to an official meeting with Parmiel and Lanciel, and the group makes haste to their location.

Upon reaching the council room, the group immediately take note that only one of the leaders is present, though her silhouette alone demands more than enough attention and emits the heavy air of refined leadership.

Standing at 6’7”, Parmiel has a tall and slender figure; her slightly hunched posture gives her an air of both intrigue and unease amongst her peers.

Her most notable feature is her lightly tousled and voluminous golden hair, which falls over her face, proving to accentuate the dreary and knowing look she carries. Around the back, her hair drops to just about waist length before flaring out in layered bunches, which serves to frame her figure. She also wears white robes with blue outlines and a golden decoration around her hip.

After initial introductions, the elven leader confirms that the trio is not behind the Foarcoast attack. Her friendly reception is sincere, once again specifically toward Sarin, unlike the cautious, pragmatic treatment Emberlyn and Kyi receive.

Finally, both parties begin to share intelligence regarding recent events, informing Parmiel of the attack on Foarcoast, and in return Parmiel informs the trio that these particular events have been a long ongoing issue, and believes their appearance may hold the key to a crucial turning point.

She requests that the trio join them on their endeavor to fight back against the group they name the Syndicate, citing that they may find clues as to the whereabouts of Vivian if they agree to do so.

Emboldened by their meeting with Parmiel, the trio agrees to aid the elven forces in a daring raid on an enemy encampment operating on Dryalis’s fringes. At the break of dawn, under the watchful eyes of Parmiel, Lanciel, and Praetor Caleth, elven soldiers and the protagonists converge on multiple hidden encampments.

Although their missions are successfully carried out with many captives freed, the operation yields no trace of Vivian. Emberlyn, using her tracking charm, discerns that Vivian’s trail has shifted far from the previous location she determined previously.

After the chaos subsides, the elven forces secure the area and tend to the wounded. The victory, though hard-won, only deepens the mystery and leaves a bittersweet taste: their enemy’s network remains elusive, and the future path grows ever murkier.

In the aftermath of battle, the mood in Dryalis softens. The elven leaders, true to their heartfelt nature, invite the trio to an outdoor inn set amid a serene courtyard adorned with ancient murals and softly glowing enchanted lanterns. Here, the rich culture of Dryalis unfurls through gentle music, art, and stories passed down through generations.

Though despite their victory, a somber Emberlyn inquires Parmiel about the Syndicate, and Vivian’s whereabouts, Parmiel unfortunately is unable to provide Emberlyn with much confidence, as she explains that the escaped remnants may have relocated in secret, and they cannot venture into lands beyond their borders, though their intelligence suggests that the criminals could have moved their operations as far east as Port Alvanda, citing their ever elusive transportation tactics that keep moral authorities in a perpetual game of cat and mouse. The newfound lead and the warm camaraderie of Dryalis kindle a flicker of hope, even as the weight of unresolved mysteries lingers.

During this period of repose, tangible gifts are bestowed upon the weary travelers. The elves offer a finely appointed carriage ride to the border of Nanus Terra, along with modest coin to cover their journey’s expenses. To Emberlyn, they present a meticulously crafted elven artifact—a magic item capable of conjuring a volley of ethereal arrows for her bow, though it draws from her personal reserves. Sarin, meanwhile, receives a prestigious political token, with Parmiel and Praetor Caleth extending an offer of influential positions within Dryalis, a proposal that leaves him both intrigued and uncertain, unfortunately for the elves however, Sarin declines the offer, stating that he plans on traveling with both Emberlyn and Kyi in their endeavors.

At dawn the next day, with hearts both heavy and hopeful, the trio departs Dryalis. They board the luxurious carriage arranged by the elven leaders, which carries them toward the border of Nanus Terra. Along the way, they reflect on the genuine, unguarded warmth of Dryalis, a stark contrast to the final days they spent on Genna Island, whose truth still looms unseen.

Before leaving, Parmiel, Lanciel, and Praetor Caleth impart final words of wisdom and blessings. Parmiel, in particular, speaks with quiet authority about the importance of remembering one’s heritage and embracing the duty that comes with power, while Lanciel’s parting remarks hint at the weight of tradition and pride. Despite their sincere farewells, the lingering mystery of Vivian’s fate casts a shadow over the celebration.

As the carriage wheels clatter along the roads, the trio contemplates their next move. Emberlyn’s determination grows stronger her tracking charm reveals a faint magical trace pointing eastward.

The three later on discuss the possibility that this is only the beginning of a larger conflict. With new intelligence and unresolved mysteries nudging them onward, the trio embarks on their journey, leaving Dryalis behind but carrying its wisdom and blessings as both a shield and a guiding light toward the next phase of their quest.

Arriving at Port Alvanda, the trio discovers that Nadjia’s company had long since departed—leaving them without a vessel to continue their journey to Homina. Their hopes of finding a ride are dashed when the sole seafarer bound for the same destination flatly denies them passage, demanding an exorbitant fee. To muster the funds, the group is forced into odd jobs around town: Sarin takes on monster-hunting assignments, Emberlyn works as a tavern waitress, and Kyi ends up cleaning in local establishments—even managing, through his unwitting charm, to convince a peddler to gift him a world encyclopedia.

During this period, Sarin encounters an enigmatic figure, a traveling swordswoman from Trisch named Mercui—with whom he forms a brief but meaningful master-student bond. The duo soon stumbles upon a lone Echo lurking on the outskirts of town; together, they confront and slay the creature, a small victory that boosts their confidence.

Port Alvanda also hosts a vibrant three-day festival celebrating its rich history. At the heart of the festivities is a public dance held in the town square with the revered Lioneo—a majestic, lion-like creature emblematic of the local culture. Under mounting peer pressure, Emberlyn is coaxed into dancing with the Lioneo. In a dramatic twist, near the dance's end, the creature transforms into a burst of pure energy that sears a glowing tattoo onto Emberlyn's shoulder, leaving the onlookers in stunned amazement.

With their earnings finally sufficient, the trio boards the seafarer’s vessel—just in time to depart, even as the grumbling captain reminds them that his outrageous price was designed to keep out inexperienced adventurers, as he was on his way to hunt a sea monster. Alongside Mercui and with Ardere stealthily hidden away in slumber, the group sets sail. Soon after, the ship confronts the juvenile sea monster Pangeos—a behemoth twice the size of their vessel. A fierce maritime battle ensues, inflicting damage on the ship, but ultimately the party prevails. The conflict forces an emergency landing in Hydrola for repairs, delaying their journey to Homina but setting the stage for the next chapter in their adventure.

After the turbulent journey at sea, the ship finally reaches the theocratic city of Hydrola. According to the crew, it will take up to two weeks to secure the necessary supplies and repairs, effectively putting the trio's mission on hold. In the meantime, Sarin, Emberlyn, and Kyi take the opportunity to explore Hydrola’s reserved and regal ambiance—a striking contrast to the communal energy of Port Alvanda. The city dazzles with its intricate water-themed architecture: majestic churches, graceful cable cars, and gondolas gliding along winding canals create an almost serene, otherworldly atmosphere. While Sarin and Kyi find moments of quiet reflection amidst the city's order, Emberlyn struggles to settle, her restless nature compelling her to venture out into the darkened streets at night in search of any clue that might lead her to Vivian.

For two nights, Emberlyn stealthily uses her tracking charm, driven by a desperate hope to uncover a lead. On one such night, she senses that someone might be trailing her. Resolutely, she turns to confront the pursuer—only to discover that it is Kyi, who had secretly followed her to ensure her safety. Their brief confrontation quickly escalates when Kyi, in a surprising display of innate power (despite losing his charm earlier), erects an ice wall to deflect what appears to be a heavy, imminent impact.

Before long, an unexpected assailant emerges—a mysterious figure wielding a formidable rocket lance. Though the newcomer is perplexed by how a few children could land a hit on him, his assault is relentless. Outmatched in raw power, Emberlyn would have been in dire straits if not for Kyi’s timely intervention. Together, they manage to hold their ground, but the fight is cut short when the attacker abruptly retreats with a quip about not being “paid enough to deal with you.”

As Kyi and Emberlyn attempt a brief chase, they are startled to see a familiar figure—Ardere—approaching nonchalantly, as if drawn by fate rather than conflict. Without exchanging many words, the trio is left with more questions than answers about this unexpected arrival, as well as the mysterious attacker’s origin. Eventually, Kyi persuades Emberlyn to return to the inn for the night, and by morning they recount the previous night's events to Sarin. Though none of them can fully explain how Kyi managed to wield magic without his charm or the true identity of the assassin, the encounter deepens the mystery surrounding the forces at work in Hydrola. Determined to avoid further isolation, Emberlyn vows to stop wandering alone, and for the remainder of their stay, the trio scours the city for any clues that might hint at the assassin’s purpose or reveal more about Ardere’s sudden appearance—all while their vessel sits quietly, waiting to carry them onward to their next destination.

After the trio lands at Port Grevalis on the western coast of Tianis, they quickly realize that their encounters with Nadjia’s forces are no longer chance skirmishes but deliberate, targeted assaults. Early in their stay, a mishap causes Sarin to break his charm, an event that forces him, in a moment of crisis, to awaken his latent Astral Projection—an ability that allows him to manifest his spirit into malleable, albeit still rudimentary, forms. This sudden surge of power marks a turning point: the very environment has shifted, and the tide now turns against them. Fearing that constant skirmishes while camping in the open will drain their strength and further imperil their mission to save Vivian, tensions rise among the trio—Emberlyn voices her frustration, accusing the others of holding her back.

The situation escalates when a masked figure bearing Nadjia’s insignia appears alongside Vivian, taunting them with a cold reminder of past betrayals. Despite their best efforts to confront the interloper, Sarin, Emberlyn, and Kyi are soundly repelled, with the enigmatic assailant retreating with Vivian in tow.

Shortly thereafter, during a heated moment amid their internal debates, Ardere reappears. In the midst of another dispute, she reveals that their magical tracking through charms is the very reason they are being followed—Nadjia can pinpoint anyone actively using them. Her advice is brusque: destroy the charm to break the tracking. Emberlyn reacts with both desperation and defiance, torn between clinging to the only means of tracking Vivian and the possibility of losing that power entirely. Meanwhile, Sarin and Kyi attempt to console her, suggesting that perhaps awakening her own innate magic—hinted at by the mysterious tattoo she received in Port Alvanda—could be a safer path. Yet despite their encouragement, Emberlyn finds herself unable to fully manifest this new power.

In the ensuing moments, the trio debates their next course of action. Emberlyn, driven by anger at the masked taunter and a need to pre-empt further threats, insists on tracking down the source of their torment using her charm. Unbeknownst to them, Ardere has been silently trailing their conversation. Before a final decision is reached, the group takes shelter in a nearby village. During a quiet interval, Emberlyn withdraws into seclusion while Sarin and Kyi practice and refine their magical skills—a brief respite that only deepens the tension.

When Emberlyn finally emerges, resolute yet conflicted, she declares that they will pursue the trail leading to Nadjia’s faction immediately. Together, they set out, following fresh tracks that seem to connect with the Syndicate’s network. Their journey leads them to one of Nadjia’s long-abandoned bases. Here, amidst the remnants of a recent conflict, they encounter Ardere at the center of a chaotic scene. Kyi attempts a cautious conversation with her, but she remains aloof—her energy fluctuating erratically as her parasite surges unpredictably. As the discussion falters, Ardere’s powers spiral out of control, and she erupts in a berserk outburst, emitting dangerously high amounts of energy in all directions. In a desperate bid to contain her, Kyi quickly raises an ice wall—a tactic reminiscent of their first encounter—while Sarin intervenes, warning that neither alone could subdue her if she continues unchecked.

The battle is protracted and one-sided, forcing the trio to seize a narrow opportunity to escape the tumult. Fleeing the chaos, they venture into a dense, foreboding forest. Despite relying on Emberlyn’s charm to navigate, the forest seems to play tricks on them—they repeatedly pass the same landmarks, as if caught in a loop. Trusting in the charm’s subtle guidance, they finally break free from the disorienting maze and emerge into an expansive clearing dominated by a vast basin and a towering structure at its center—a silent, enigmatic landmark that promises answers and portends the next stage of their journey.


As the trio advances toward the secluded tower, their resolve is bolstered by the recent defeat of the masked assailant—even as sporadic clashes with Echoes punctuate their journey. Reaching the tower’s base, they begin an arduous climb until they finally breach the upper chamber. There, they confront an unmasked figure with a vaguely familiar face. With a wry smile, Nadjia greets them, teasingly asking how they found their way to her hidden refuge—a place she claims she chose for its isolation, allowing her uninterrupted research. She launches into an extended lecture about her ambitions and pivotal moments of her life before turning her piercing gaze on the trio to inquire about their knowledge of the Echoes.

Kyi offers a measured explanation, only to be met with Nadjia’s mocking retort that after all their struggles, they still know nothing. Undeterred, she continues, detailing the origin and purpose of the Echoes and then delving into the truth behind Esca Gehenna—revealing that the island’s inhabitants are, in fact, the children of slaves and criminals rather than of noble blood. She confesses that when she discovered that six islanders had escaped, she realized their vessels were too weak; consequently, she resolved to create vessels strong enough to endure her experiments, naming Vivian, Emberlyn, Sarin, Kyi, and Ardere as her subjects (with Rivets—Sarin’s sister—mysteriously missing for reasons yet unrevealed).

Interrupting the lecture, Emberlyn declares that she cares for nothing else but one purpose. Sensing an opening, Nadjia challenges her to surrender her weapon in exchange for a glimpse of Vivian; however, Emberlyn is swiftly tricked and teleported far away. Nadjia then turns to Sarin and Kyi, prophesying that they are nearing the pinnacle of her research. As the two prepare to engage her, Ardere unexpectedly enters the chamber. A cold mist envelops the room, and when it dissipates, the group finds themselves on a vast, ethereal ocean under a cloudy sky. A fierce, hard-fought battle ensues between Ardere, Sarin, and Kyi against Nadjia. Although they narrowly prevail, the conflict transitions to an open green field where, upon rushing to a subdued, wounded Nadjia engaged in quiet conversation with Ardere, the enigmatic figure vanishes into mist. Ardere cryptically reassures them that "not even magic can heal those wounds in time," then nonchalantly departs. Kyi, unsettled, questions her intentions, only to receive a morbid reply that she might simply throw herself into a ditch before moving on.

In the aftermath, Sarin expresses deep concern for Emberlyn and vows to search for her, while Kyi remains apprehensive about Ardere’s unpredictable motives. The two reluctantly agree to split up—Sarin setting off to find Emberlyn, and Kyi following Ardere—with a plan to reconvene at the western port of Grevalis in a few months if their respective missions prove successful.

After parting ways with Kyi, Sarin returns to Nadjia’s tower in a desperate bid to uncover any clue about Emberlyn’s whereabouts. Finding nothing substantial, he abandons the tower and wanders until fate leads him to a detachment of the Arc Platoon—a specialized squadron from Homina tasked with investigating local criminal activity. Initially, the Arc Platoon views Sarin with suspicion and prejudice, but as their shared goal of saving Emberlyn and dismantling the local criminal network becomes clear, they decide to work together.

The team is led by the charismatic Flaemignis Arschwal, whose manipulative magic—known as “Cancel”—can nullify enemy spells within a certain radius. Alongside him is Dani Exsen, a pragmatic precision combatant whose “Bang” magic fires high-speed projectiles, and Ranar Ryeman, a brooding fighter whose explosive “Burst” powers make him dangerously unpredictable. Freesia Waters, with his water-shaping “Aqua” abilities, offers both strategic defense and unexpected insight, while the energetic Settalie Windfried, whose “Sunbathing” magic harnesses light to boost her physical prowess, quickly emerges as one of Sarin’s closest allies—even as she provokes Emberlyn with biting remarks. In exchange for teasing Sarin with trivia about his own Vaephilim heritage and the distant, mysterious homeland of Vaery, Settalie becomes both a mentor in combat and a catalyst for Sarin’s growing leadership.

As the newly formed team painstakingly pieces together clues, they eventually uncover critical information pinpointing Emberlyn’s location. Their next moves are swiftly planned even as the Nubilim’s elite assassin, Cerberus, makes a brief, brutal appearance during a recon mission—demonstrating vicious skill and nearly claiming the lives of some platoon members. This encounter cements the looming threat that will challenge them in the battles to come.

Meanwhile, far from the schemes of the Syndicate, Emberlyn finds herself in a forced-labor encampment alongside Vivian and Atlai—having been teleported away by Nadjia. There, she quietly hones her newfound magic, symbolized by the dormant Lioneo tattoo on her shoulder, and begins secretly planning an internal revolt to free her sister and Atlai. Seizing a fleeting chance for escape, Emberlyn flees alone, wandering the wilderness until, at her darkest hour, the ancient and powerful Nazerati appears. His cold, probing questions force her to confront her own motivations; their confrontation evolves into a test of will rather than a simple battle. Impressed by her resolve, Nazerati forcibly activates her Wild Icon, branding a large, dragon-like emblem on her back—a rare gift that she can only summon in moments of dire necessity.

This dual upheaval—the internal uprising in the encampment and the external assault by Sarin and the Arc Platoon—culminates in a climactic raid that liberates the camp, with Emberlyn achieving her immediate goal of freeing Vivian and Atlai. As the dust settles, Sarin recalls his promise to reunite with Kyi and the time with the Arc Platoon must be put on hold.

Preparing to leave, Sarin assists Emberlyn, Vivian, and Atlai in gathering their meager supplies for the journey back to Port Grevalis. Yet Settalie, driven by personal motives and the chance to glean more about Sarin’s mysterious heritage, pleads with Flaemignis and cunningly secures her place among them. During the departure, she jabs at Emberlyn while sharing tidbits of elven lore and Vaery’s rich legacy—a subtle, personal attempt to spark Sarin’s curiosity about his origins.

Just before reaching the port town, the group is ambushed by a monster. In the nick of time, Ardere and a re-emerging Kyi arrive, their newfound prowess and hardened demeanors starkly contrasting with their former selves. Settalie, momentarily interested in Kyi, is quickly subdued by Ardere’s imposing presence. This chaotic encounter not only underscores the escalating danger but also sets the stage for the convergence of multiple narrative threads in the journey ahead.
