<p>Third time's the charm?</p> 
<p>Using everything I learned from the last three attempts, I think I got a good grasp on using hatching, 
though there are a couple of other things I want to experiment with aswell, like using solid blocks and gradients, kind of like
a typical "manga" style.</p>
<p>I was orignally going to draw in a cableknit sweater to contrast with the texture I did for the hair, but after having spent an entire day (literally)
stroking every hair strand, I ended up changing my mind, drawing a tube top and calling it a day. Maybe next time I'll try my hand at it. Or not.</p>
