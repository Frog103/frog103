<p>Better and Faster?</p>

<p> I did a handful of sketching exercises that I mentioned in a previous post on my own, I'm pretty happy with where its at, 
especially with how easy I picked up on it and the speed that I'd be able to crank them out. I've made plans on writing a handful of comics and
coloring in black&white looks to be the best way to go about it, since my current process involving color has definitely improved, but not nearly as 
efficient as I would need it to be, which would be a major issue moving forward.</p>

<p>You could probably guess by the title and thumbnail, that this particular post is about addressing that issue, which would be correct.
At the moment I spend a general average of 18 hours per piece and about 23+ hours for my more recent posts.</p>

<p>Now while that doesn't sound terrible at first, most of my posts only feature a single character with them, and I have barely attempted to draw
backgrounds in any capacity, which means if I were to move onto creating full pieces or similar, the amount of time I spend would likely double, 
possibly going as high as 70 hours, and I'd rather not subject myself to that sort of trouble, as I can really only pay attention for 2-3 hours at most.</p>
