Better and Faster?
</p>

<p>
I did a handful of sketching exercises that I mentioned in a previous post on my own, I'm pretty happy with where its at, 
especially with how easily I picked up on it and the speed that I'd be able to put them out. I've made plans on writing a handfull of comics and
coloring in black & white looks to be the best way to go about it, since my current process involving color has definitely improved, but not nearly as 
efficient as I want it to be, which isn't something I should sit on.

You could probably guess by the title and thumbnail that this particular post is about addressing that issue, which would be correct.
At the moment I spend a general average of 18 hours per piece and about 23+ hours for my more recent posts.

Now while that doesn't sound terrible at first, most of my posts only feature a single character with them, and I have barely attempted to draw
backgrounds in any capacity, which means if I were to move onto creating full pieces or similar, the amount of time I spend on a single piece 
would double, going as high as 70 hours, which I find unacceptable.
</p>

<p> 
So I decided to take a look at my art process, and through that I experimented with different methods of coloring to cut down on time, 
which you might have already noticed, and afterward I decided that a new coloring process and/or art style was the only way to fix the problem in 
a way that I would be happy with long-term.

Only problem is that I pigeon-holed myself into a weird frankenstein art style thinking that i'd fix my bad habits on the go and be fine, 
so trying to walk it back and try something completely new was rough transition that I ended up stuck in. Fortunately after about a month of 
messing around I got insight from an outside perspective and their method of coloring was ironically the reverse of what I was doing before and 
during my experimental period, and it led to immediate results in less than half the time I spend coloring on average (which is ~12 hours).

This piece on the left is the result of using this new method, which I think completely blows majority of my other works out of the water in terms
of depth and coloring. If I were to combine this new method with some small techniques I picked up previously, along with drawing more often, I 
could take this artstyle much further. But for now I'm happy where I've ended up.
